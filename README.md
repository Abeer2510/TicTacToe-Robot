# TicTacToe-Robot

A TicTacToe bot powered by **Reinforcement Learning** that achieves a **100% no-lose rate**. The solution was built entirely using core Python features and custom algorithms without relying on external libraries (except for basic utilities like `copy` and `random`)

## Overview

This TicTacToe bot has been trained using **Temporal Difference Learning** (TD Learning) to play optimally. After training the bot against an opponent that randomly selects moves, the bot is able to achieve a flawless performanceâ€”never losing a game after 100,000 training games.

The bot is designed to play against an opponent that goes first, making the challenge more interesting since it is generally easier to win if you start first. After extensive training, the bot can play 10,000 games without losing. This clearly indicates that the robot has picked up on strategies that allow it to not lose in any scenario.
